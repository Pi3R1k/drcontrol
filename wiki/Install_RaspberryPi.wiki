#summary Installation for Raspberry Pi and like

= Introduction =

Instructions how to install the needed libraries and test DRControl utility to control Denkovi USB Relay board.

= Tested on =

  * [http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads Raspberry Pi with Raspbian 3.2.27+]
  * Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop via VMWare (on Mac OSX)
  * [http://denkovi.com/product/44/usb-four-4-relay-output-module-board-for-home-automation.html Denkovi 4 USB Relay Board]

= Python Libraries =

There are two libraries that are needed to interface the relay board.

  * Python-FTDI 
  * PyLibFTDI

= Install =

Install Python-FTDI library

{{{
# sudo apt-get install python-ftdi
}}}

Install the FTDI wrapper PyLibFTDI usinf PIP.

{{{
# sudo pip install pylibftdi
}}}

If you don't have PIP installed you can install it easily by following command

{{{
# sudo apt-get install python-pip
}}}

= Alternative install =

This installation will get the latest pylibftdi directly from the sources. You will need Mercurial for this.

Install Python-FTDI library

{{{
# sudo apt-get install python-ftdi
}}}

If you don't have Mercurial installed, then install it as following

{{{
# sudo apt-get install mercurial
}}}

Get sources and install pylibftdi

{{{
# cd /tmp
# sudo hg clone https://bitbucket.org/codedstructure/pylibftdi pylibftdi
# cd pylibftdi
# sudo setup.py install
# cd /tmp
# rm -rf pylibftdi
}}}

= Upgrade =

If you have installed the pylibftdi with PIP and now want to upgrade it to latest "pre" release version from the sources, then first uninstall existing with "pip uninstall"

{{{
# sudo pip uninstall pulibftdi
}}}

And after that use the "alternative install" procedure above to get the latest pylibftdi.

= Test =

If you have the relay board connected, then you can run a quick test by entering following command

{{{
# python -m pylibftdi.examples.list_devices
}}}

Example printout

{{{
root@raspberrypi:~# python -m pylibftdi.examples.list_devices
FTDI:FT245R USB FIFO:A6VV5PHY
root@raspberrypi:~# 
}}}

Note that this command will list all FTDI devices, so if you have more of them, then it will be listed as well.
