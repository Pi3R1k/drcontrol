== Error: device not found (-3) ==

If following error occur when the device is accessed

{{{
pylibftdi._base.FtdiError: device not found (-3)
}}}

It means that the only solution (what I know of) is to unload the FTDI kernel extension, by executing following command;

{{{
# sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/FTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext
}}}

{{{
# sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/FTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext
